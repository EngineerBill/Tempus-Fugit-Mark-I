About Tempus Fugit:

Developed as the author’s first attempt at a Pebble non-watchface app, this program is a light-hearted but hopefully somewhat useful event-Pebble App. In addition to the traditional Stopwatch and Countdown Timer functionalities, the program also provides a real time meeting cost calculator, as well as both left handed and right handed variants of the SteamCab Simple Analog Watchface.

The Meeting Cost Calculator automatically provides the total cost of any timed event, based upon three user-controlled parameters (total number of attendees, average salary and elapsed time). If you'd like see the cost evolve as your event is happening, you can start the function timer and your Pebble will provide you with real time meeting cost updates. You can also enter elapsed time manually and see the results instantly.

Both the Stopwatch and Countdown functions include an Alert feature. the watch will sound a distinctive Vibration every “Interval” minutes whenever the timer is running.

The distinctive SteamCab Analog Watchface App can be configured to operate in either “right handed” (clockwise) or “left handed” (“counterclockwise) mode. While operating, all your timers will continue to work, allowing your Pebble to multitask!

Conceived as a learning experience, the author used the development of this program to become familiar with both the available Pebble programming environments and the Pebble SDK API. A complete annotated version of the source code is available via GitHub (www.github.com/EngineerBill/Tempus-Fugit-Mark-I). In addition, the entire development process, as well as an overview of the Tempus Fugit App, will be published at the SteamCab blog (steamcab.wordpress.com). Hopefully this will help other would-be Pebblers who wish to learn how to develop for this state-of-the-art Smart Mobile platform…
